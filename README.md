# work-day-planner 

## Description:

The purpose of this project was to create a virtual, interactive, daily scheduler. I was given HTML and CSS code, and created the JavaScript file from scratch. My goal was to make the existing structure more interactive and usable. That included adding the current date to the header through Moment, creating a table-like structure for easy reading (includes hour, text area for typing plans, and a save button), and color-coding hour-blocks based on their relationship to the present hour of each day. Additionally, I made it possible for users to type in their own information and save that information to local storage so that, even if the page refreshed, it would save to the website display. All of this is perfectly functional and taught me a lot about local storage, using jQuery, using Bootstrap, and using Moment.
